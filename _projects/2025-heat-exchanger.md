A heat exchanger is a common thermodynamic device used to heat or cool a liquid. In its simplest form, two liquid streams at different temperatures run through the heat exchanger and transfer heat to each other. The cooler liquid will heat up due to the heat from the hotter liquid, and vice versa.

In an ideal heat exchanger, the device is completely insulated with the outside world, so Q = 0. Furthermore, no work is needed to keep the liquids flowing. When the device has been working for a while, it should be approximated as steady state, so mass in = mass out. The liquids are always on the same plane as each other, so there's no change in potential energy, and kinetic energy changes will likely be negligible. From these assumptions, the following relation can be made:
